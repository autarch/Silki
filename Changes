0.12

- The mason cache directory will be deleted when Silki is installed, to ensure
  that templates are re-read.

- Several pages that linked to users did not show the user's image. Now all
  links to a user should include the user's image.

- Small improvement to diff display.

- When a search didn't find any results, the search page did not make this
  clear.


0.11  2010-07-22

- The PSGI feature did not list Plack::Middleware::ReverseProxy as a prereq.

- Improved the example ubuntu init script. It no longer runs as root, and the
  pid is stored in a directory under /var/run owned by the $USER in the init
  script (www-data).

- When a user without edit permission viewed a page with no tags, the tags box
  was just empty, which looks weird.

- You can now pass --hostname to the Build.PL to pick the default web hostname
  for your Silki installation.

- Editing a user's preferences set their is_admin flag to false if the user
  doing the editing was also an admin.

- The list of all users (/users) was broken.


0.10  2010-07-20

- Silki::Manual::Admin now describes deploying Silki with Apache 2 & Starman,
  a setup I've actually been able to make work. I thought I had mod_fastcgid
  working, but I didn't.

- Added bin/silki.psgi

- Added a sample init script (which works on Ubuntu 10.04) at
  eg/ubuntu-init.d/silki.

- Attempting to log in with a non-existent username caused a server error. Now
  it simply returns a sane error to the user.

- Improved the layout wherever user image thumbnails are used, and added a
  default user icon to make the UI more consistent.

0.09  2010-07-16

- The migrations in previous releases were buggy. If you've migrated a schema,
  the inc/migations/fixup.sql file contains the SQL statements necessary to
  fix your schema. If you're just playing with Silki, and don't have any data
  you need to save, it might be easier to simply drop the existing schema and
  re-install.

- Added the ability for each user to upload an image for their profile. This
  is used in their profile, and in various places that refer to users (recent
  changes, page history, etc.)


0.08  2010-06-08

- Any page with more than two headers will now have an table of contents at
  the top of the page view.

- Added style for tables in page content (but they still overflow their parent
  container and mess up the page layout).

- We need to call TO_TSQUERY on full text queries in order to get stemming
  (and probably other tweaks) on the search terms.

- In-memory file handles were not handling unicode data correctly, which could
  lead to warnings and bad output, particularly when rendering a page's
  content.


0.07  2010-06-05

- Fixed a stupid bug that prevented logging in.

- Add a "restore this revision" button when viewing an older revision.

- Added various revision-related links at the bottom of each page
  (compare/view previous/next).


0.06  2010-06-04

- *WARNING* - Lots of database changes. Many varchar columns are now text or
  citext. What's citext? It's contrib data type for case-insensitive text,
  which means that sorts and equality are case-insensitive. Postgres 8.4 ships
  citext, but 8.3 does not. If you are running 8.3 and install citext manually
  into your contrib dir, this should work. Patches to make this all smoother
  are welcome.

  Did I mention that Silki is still alpha?

* The search code blew up on multi-word searches. Now a multi-word search is
  interpreted as requiring all the words.

* Fixed links to user profiles inside a wiki so they point to the per-wiki
  profile.

* Per-wiki user profiles now show some information about the user that is
  specific to the wiki.

* When formatting a page link to another wiki's page, the links were leaking
  information by showing whether or not the page existed. Now such links
  simply show up as "Inacessible page" in the HTML output.


0.05  2010-06-03

- The attachments list for a wiki is now paged, with 50 files shown per page.

- Added paging to the orphan and wanted pages lists.

- Show the attachment count next to the Attachments link when viewing a page.

- Paging for application-wide user, wiki, and domain lists was broken.

- The wiki dashboard's active users box now just looks for activity in the
  past month. Otherwise, it has to look at all revision of all pages, which
  can be very slow.

- The site's "all users" list now defaults to showing only active users, but
  offers an option to show disabled users as well.


0.04  2010-06-01

- *WARNING* - this release contains the first database migration for Silki. If
  by some chance you actually have real data in Silki (did you not see the
  alpha warning in the docs?), make a backup first.

- Files are now attached to a page, not the wiki. This makes more sense, since
  you may want to associate a set of files with a page, yet not link to all of
  them directly from the page.

- Implemented page renaming, at both the API and UI levels.

- The revision created when adding a file to a page now has a comment, and is
  created by the system user, not the user which uploaded the file.

- Page history now shows a revision's comment, if it has one.


0.03   2010-05-31

- Doc and packaging fixes so this looks a little nicer on search.cpan.org.


0.02   2010-05-31

- Fixes a PAUSE indexing issue. I left a monkey patch in a state that was
  visible to PAUSE.


0.01   2010-05-31

- First release, still very much an alpha.
