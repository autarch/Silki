<h2>Text Formatting</h2>

<p>
Silki uses an extended dialect of
the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> text
formatting language. Markdown is designed to be a natural language for adding
formatting to plain text.
</p>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>

<p>
A paragraph is one or more lines of text. Paragraphs are separated by a blank
line.
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output, keep_paras => 1 &>
This is a paragraph. It has several sentences. It
also has a line break.

This is a separate paragraph consisting of a single
sentence on two lines.
</&>

<h3>Headers</h3>

<p class="advice">
We recommend that you don't use first-level headers in pages. The page title
itself should serve as the first-level header. Inside the page, start with
second-level headers and work from there.
</p>

<p>
Headers come in two variants. underlined and prefixed. The underlined variant
puts the header text on one line and the header markers on the next:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output, fixed => 1 &>
Second-level Header
-------------------
</&>

<p>
You can also create headers by prefixing the text with hash marks (#):
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
## Second-level Header

### Third-level Header
</&>

<h3>Wiki Links</h3>

<p>
Linking a page in the same wiki is simple, just wrap the page title in double
parentheses:
</p>

<pre class="markdown-docs">
((Page Title))
</pre>

<p>
If you want to link to a page in another wiki on the same server, you need to
include the wiki name with the page name, separated by a slash (/):
</p>

<pre class="markdown-docs">
((Other Wiki/Page Title))
</pre>

<h3>External Links</h3>

<p>
When linking to an external site, you can set the link text (the text people
see in the page), and the URL:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
[a great directory of veg-friendly restaurants](http://www.vegguide.org)
</&>

<p>
If you just want to put a URL in the text, wrap it in angle brackets:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
<http://www.vegguide.org>
</&>

<h3>Linking to Files</h3>

<p>
You can link to files in the current wiki, or any other wiki you have access
to.
</p>

<pre class="markdown-example">Take a look at the PDF: {{file: file.pdf}}</pre>

<div class="markdown-output">
  <p>Take a look at the PDF: <a href="#" title="Download this file">file.pdf</a></p>
</div>

<p>
If you want to change the link text, put the link text in square brackets
before the link:
</p>

<pre class="markdown-example">Take a look at [the attached PDF]{{file: file.pdf}}</pre>

<div class="markdown-output">
  <p>Take a look at <a href="#" title="Download this file">the attached PDF</a></p>
</div>

<p>
You can also link to files in other wikis. Of course, if a user viewing the
page does not have access to the other wiki, they won't be able to see the
file.
</p>

<pre class="markdown-example">Take a look at the PDF: {{file: Other Wiki/file.pdf}}</pre>

<div class="markdown-output">
  <p>Take a look at the PDF: <a href="#" title="Download this file">file.pdf</a></p>
</div>

<h3>Linking to Images</h3>

<p>
Image links look like file links, but they embed the image in the wiki
page:</p>
</p>

<pre class="markdown-example">The attached logo: {{image: logo.png}}</pre>

<div class="markdown-output">
  <p>
    The attached logo:
    <a href="<% Silki::URI::static_uri( '/images/vegguide-logo.png' ) %>"
       title="View this file"
       ><img src="<% Silki::URI::static_uri( '/images/vegguide-logo.png' ) %>"
             alt="vegguide-logo.png"
             height="66"
             width="400"
             /></a>
  </p>
</div>

<p>
The image will be scaled down so that is no wider than 400 pixels, and no
taller than 150 pixels. The image will also link to a larger version of
itself.
</p>

<h3>Bold and Italics</h3>

<p>
To make some text bold, wrap it with two asterisks (**):
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
A **bold chunk** in the middle.
</&>

<p>
To make text italic, wrap it with one asterisk (*):
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
An *italic chunk* in the middle.
</&>

<p>
You can also mix these italics and bold:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
A *ridiculously **strong piece of text***!
</&>

<h3>Lists</h3>

<p>
You can create bullet lists and numbered lists by prefixing each line with
either a bullet (*) or a number (1., 2.).
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
</&>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
1. Number 1
2. Number 2
</&>

<p>
You can also nest lists using indentation:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
* 1-A
* 1-B
    * 2-B
    * 3-B
* 1-C
    * 2-C
        * three
* 1-D
</&>

<h3>Tables</h3>

<p>
Silki extends Markdown to add table support. A table can have an optional set
of header rows, a body, and an optional caption. Here's a basic table:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output, fixed => 1 &>
+-------------+------------------------------+--------+
| name        | description                  | price  |
+-------------+------------------------------+--------+
| gizmo       | Takes care of the doohickies |   1.99 |
| doodad      | Collects *gizmos*            |  23.80 |
| dojigger    | Foo                          | 102.98 |
| thingamabob | Self-explanatory, no?        |   0.99 |
+-------------+------------------------------+--------+
</&>

<p>
The header rows are marked off by a line consisting only of "+---+". You can
have multiple header rows:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output, fixed => 1 &>
+-------------+-------+--------+---------+
| Location           || Services        ||
+-------------+-------+--------+---------+
| City        | State | Sales? | Repair? |
+-------------+-------+--------+---------+
| Minneapolis | MN    | Yes    | Yes     |
| Chicago     | IL    | Yes    | No      |
| Columbus    | OH    | No     | No      |
+-------------+-------+--------+---------+
</&>

<p>
This example also demonstrates column grouping. By putting two column
separators next to each other ("||"), we can group cells together.
</p>

<p>
Header rows are not required, nor are the markers at the beginning and end of
the table:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output, fixed => 1 &>
[Locations and Services]
| Minneapolis | MN    | Yes    | Yes     |
| Chicago     | IL    | Yes    | No      |
| Columbus    | OH    | No     | No      |
</&>

<p>
The text in brackets ("[...]") is the table's caption.
</p>

<p>
By default, text in a cell is left-aligned. By adding appropriate whitespace,
you can cause the cell to be centered or right-aligned:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output, fixed => 1 &>
| Left        |    Center    |          Right |
| Longer text | For contrast | And cell width |
</&>

<h3>Blockquotes</h3>

<p>
Use a blockquote for extended quotes of material from somewhere else. A
blockquote is created by prefixing each line with an greater-than (>):
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output, keep_paras => 1 &>
> This is our hope. This is the faith that I go
> back to the South with. With this faith we will
> be able to hew out of the mountain of despair
> a stone of hope. With this faith we will be
> able to transform the jangling discords of
> our nation into a beautiful symphony of
> brotherhood. With this faith we will be able
> to work together, to pray together, to
> struggle together, to go to jail together,
> to stand up for freedom together, knowing
> that we will be free one day.
>
> -- Martin Luther King, Jr.
</&>

<h3>Horizontal Rule</h3>

<p>
You can insert a horizontal rule into a page by inserting four or more dashes
(-) surrounded by blank lines
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
Content ...

----

More content ...
</&>

<h3>Monospace / Code</h3>

<p>
If you want to insert code (monospaced text) inside some text, you can
surround it by backticks (`). If you want a standalone pre-formatted monospace
block, simply indent each line by four spaces:
</p>

<&| .markdown-and-output &>
To set the variable `$foo`, write `$foo = $value`.
</&>

<&| .markdown-and-output, fixed => 1,  &>
    while ( $x > 1 ) {
        ....
    }
</&>
