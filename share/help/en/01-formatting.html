<h2>Text Formatting</h2>

<p>
Silki uses an extended dialect of
the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> text
formatting language. Markdown is designed to be a natural language for adding
formatting to plain text.
</p>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>

<p>
A paragraph is one or more lines of text. Paragraphs are separated by a blank
line.
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
This is a paragraph. It has several sentences. It
also has a line break.

This is a separate paragraph consisting of a single
sentence on two lines.
</pre>

<h3>Headers</h3>

<p class="advice">
We recommend that you don't use first-level headers in pages. The page title
itself should serve as the first-level header. Inside the page, start with
second-level headers and work from there.
</p>

<p>
Headers come in two variants. underlined and prefixed. The underlined variant
puts the header text on one line and the header markers on the next:
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs fixed">
Second-level Header
-------------------
</pre>

<p>
You can also create headers by prefixing the text with hash marks (#):
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
## Second-level Header

### Third-level Header
</pre>

<h3>Wiki Links</h3>

<p>
Linking a page in the same wiki is simple, just wrap the page title in double
square brackets:
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
[[Page Title]]
</pre>

<p>
If you want to link to a page in another wiki on the same server, you need to
include the wiki name with the page name, separated by a slash (/):
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
[[Other Wiki/Page Title]]
</pre>

<h3>External Links</h3>

<p>
When linking to an external site, you can set the link text (the text people
see in the page), and the URL:
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
(a great directory of veg-friendly restaurants)[http://www.vegguide.org]
</pre>

<p>This will be formatted as:</p>

<p class="markup-docs">
<a href="http://www.vegguide.org/">a great directory of veg-friendly restaurants</a>
</p>

<p>
If you just want to put a URL in the text, wrap it in angle brackets:
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
<http://www.vegguide.org>
</pre>

<h3>Linking to Files</h3>

TODO

<h3>Linking to Images</h3>

TODO

<h3>Bold and Italics</h3>

<p>
To make some text bold, wrap it with two asterisks (**):
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
A **bold chunk** in the middle.
</pre>

<p>
To make text italic, wrap it with one asterisk (*):
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
An *italic chunk* in the middle.
</pre>

<h3>Lists</h3>

<p>
You can create bullet lists and numbered lists by prefixing each line with
either a bullet (*) or a number (1., 2.).
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2

1. Number 1
2. Number 2
</pre>

<p>
You can also nest lists using indentation:
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
* 1-A
* 1-B
    * 2-B
    * 3-B
* 1-C
    * 2-C
        * three
* 1-D
</pre>

<p>
This becomes:
</p>

<div class="markup-docs">
<ul>
  <li>1-A</li>
  <li>1-B
    <ul>
      <li>2-B</li>
      <li>2-C</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1-C
    <ul>
      <li>2-C
        <ul>
          <li>three</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1-D</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Tables</h3>

<p>
While Markdown does not support

<h3>Blockquotes</h3>

<p>
Use a blockquote for extended quotes of material from somewhere else. A
blockquote is created by prefixing each line with an greater-than (>):
<p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
> This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With
> this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of
> hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of
> our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will
> be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to
> jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free
> one day.
>
> -- Martin Luther King, Jr.
</pre>

<h3>Horizontal Rule</h3>

<p>
You can insert a horizontal rule into a page by inserting four or more dashes
(-) surrounded by blank lines
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
Content ...

----

More content ...
</pre>

<h3>Monospace</h3>

<p>
If you want to insert code (monospaced text) inside some text, you can
surround it by backticks (`). If you want a standalone pre-formatted monospace
block, simply indent each line by four spaces:
</p>

<pre class="markup-docs">
To set the variable `$foo`, write `$foo = $value`.

    while ( $x > 1 ) {
        ....
    }
</pre>

<p>This will be formatted as:</p>

<div class="markup-docs">
<p>
To set the variable <code>$foo</code>, write <code>$foo = $value</code>.

<pre><code>while ( $x > 1 ) {
    ....
}</code></pre>
</pre>
</div>

<h3>More Info</h3>

<p>
We have purposely only documented a part of the full Markdown specification
here, in order to keep things simple. However, we do support
the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">full Markdown
language</a>.
