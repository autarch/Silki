= Navigation

* Tabs (Home, etc) should all refer to current wiki
* include link to "real" home page in small upper right links

= System admin

* List of all wikis
* List of all users
* System admin can edit other users

= Random features

* Backlinks for attachments?
** wikipedia implements attachments & images as special types of pages, I think

* list of recently viewed pages in side bar

* Determine wiki by path or hostname (dev.wiki.company.com or wiki.company.com/wiki/dev)?

= Reporting

* Logins
* Page views, edits, creation, deletion
* Attachment views, edits
* Added users?
** This is probably only necessary if there are plans to charge per-user-in-a-wiki, which seems like a big PITA
* Created wiki, deleted wiki

** only shows up in search when explicitly asked for

= Users
