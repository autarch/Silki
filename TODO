= ACL system

predefined sets of ACLS

* Public, totally open (like wikipedia)
** Guests can read, edit, upload attachments
* Public, join to edit
** Guests can read, registration/joining the wiki is available
* Public, invite to edit
** Guests can read, joining is by invitation only
* Private
** Invitation only

= Random features

* Backlinks for attachments?
** wikipedia implements attachments & images as special types of pages, I think

* Determine wiki by path or hostname (dev.wiki.company.com or wiki.company.com/wiki/dev)?

= Reporting

* Logins
* Page views, edits, creation, deletion
* Attachment views, edits
* Added users?
** This is probably only necessary if there are plans to charge per-user-in-a-wiki, which seems like a big PITA
* Created wiki, deleted wiki

= Archiving feature

* auto-archiving of unread content somehow
** only shows up in search when explicitly asked for

= Users

* allow email aliases for purposes of logging in
