* Determine wiki by path or hostname (dev.wiki.company.com or wiki.company.com/wiki/dev)?

* AJAX suggestions for tags

* FT search for attachment content

* Per-wiki user lists, sortable by something interesting (# of pages
  edited/created, recency of edit, etc).

= Reporting

* Logins?
* Attachment views, edits?

= Archiving feature

** only shows up in search when explicitly asked for

= Users

* allow email aliases for purposes of logging in

   session mechanism
