= Random features

* Backlinks for attachments?
** wikipedia implements attachments & images as special types of pages, I think

* Determine wiki by path or hostname (dev.wiki.company.com or wiki.company.com/wiki/dev)?

* AJAX suggestions for tags

* FT search for attachment content

* Per-wiki user lists, sortable by something interesting (# of pages
  edited/created, recency of edit, etc).

* Move/copy pages between wikis

* Gardening features - mass tag/untag, mass delete, mass move, mass rename via
  regex, ...

* Proper WYSIWYG editor

* Live preview for non-WYSIWYG editor?

* Image gallery like MojoMojo?

= Reporting

* Logins?
* Attachment views, edits?

= Archiving feature

* auto-archiving of unread content somehow
** only shows up in search when explicitly asked for

= Users

* allow email aliases for purposes of logging in

= Other

* Remove all monkey-patching (Session plugin, ErrorHandling, HTTP::Body
  filename preservation hack)
** session unhacking would ideally involve building an alternate, much simpler
   session mechanism
